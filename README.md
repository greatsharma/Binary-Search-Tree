# Binary-Search-Tree
A C++ implementation of Binary Seach Tree. This was implemented during my under-graduation practicals, so I thought why not to share these here for better reach :)


This implementation has **22 most widely used functions** for a BST. You can refer all the supported functions [here](https://github.com/greatsharma/Binary-Search-Tree/blob/master/BST/header/menu.h). This project is done in `Visual Studio 2017` and you can directly execute this using the same, or you can use the implemetations directly in other editor by using these [header](https://github.com/greatsharma/Binary-Search-Tree/tree/master/BST/header) and [src](https://github.com/greatsharma/Binary-Search-Tree/tree/master/BST/src) files.
